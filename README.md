# Coding Tank Homework - Python Basics

This repository contains the homework assignment for the Python Basics class in the Coding Tank program. The assignment focuses on the following topics:

- Data types
- Variables
- Input
- Output

## Problem Statement

You have been hired to develop a simple program for a convenience store. The store owner wants a program that allows them to record the name and quantity of different products sold, calculate the total value of the purchase, and display a receipt to the customer.

## Solution

The solution to the problem is implemented in Python, using the concepts learned in the first Python class. The program prompts the user for the customer's name, the quantity, and the price of each product. It then calculates the total value of the purchase and displays a receipt to the customer.

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Install Python on your machine if you haven't already.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the cloned repository's directory.
4. Run the following command to execute the program:

```bash
python main.py
```

5. Follow the prompts to enter the customer's name, product quantities, and prices.
6. The program will display the receipt with the total value of the purchase.

Feel free to modify the program or extend it with additional features as needed.

Happy coding!
